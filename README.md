# stock-analysis
### Challenge
####There are two macros containing refactored code located in Module 2
  #####a) RefactoredAllStocksAnalysis()
  #####b) RefactoredSpecifiedStocksAnalysis()
  
Both macros Set & Match tickerIndex, Apply tickerIndex to Arrays, and Loop through the Arrays 

Key Features of RefactoredAllStocksAnalysis() include
   i) Arrays are correctly created for tickers, volume, starting prices, ending prices and Return
  ii) Auto initialized the tickers array 
 iii) Does not require raw stock data to be sorted by ticker column
      However, the raw stock data must still be sorted by date column
      This is an improvement from the original module's code 
       
Key Features of RefactoredSpecifiedStocksAnalysis() include
   i) Arrays are correctly created for tickers, volume and Return
  ii) The tickers array must be intialized with values 
 iii) same
